IDEAS

mind control tool
you control enemy when you move in on them

draw tools in random order so that it's not repetitive to see the same order again and again

limit tools to 4 slots
    could do 6, to stick with 6's

laser

multiple tools per cell?

when not enough space for tools
    destroy?
    leave?
    dont allow to pick up

push tool, that pushes after player moves
    (so don't need actual input, can go next to entity and it will be pushed)
    kind of like a different kind of defense
