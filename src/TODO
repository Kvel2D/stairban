IDEAS

could do more complex tetrominoe shapes
    but need to consider whether this can fit mechanically and if it works
    will need to determine how they fall etc

could potentially make boxes move like player on stairs, need to check if it works well as a mechanic

what happens if you push a box with a thing on it
    currently can't push
    other options:
        you push the box and the thing
        you push the box and now the thing is on top of you
