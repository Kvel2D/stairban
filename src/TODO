draw

dont code buttons as entities, just make a different system
    no reason to have multiple entities per cell other than buttons, so it's too much of an exception to make a general system

IDEAS

draw by combining sprites dynamically

can't push things onto yourself
    rules would be too loose and easy
    always need to push things onto others

do legs have to be below?

might have to limit to just
    center + each four direction
    going deeper too complicated

ghost entities?

numbered tools?
    multiple tools that stack together

can push tools onto uncontrolled objects and they will do stuff
    push on a box will act as a spring that pushes things in front after player's turn

    legs will move thing in direction of attachment
